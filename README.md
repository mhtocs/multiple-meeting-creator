A flask app to create meetings using spreadsheet data

For work I need to create multiple meetings at a time, sometimes 5 different
meeting in a day :O.The information for the meetings i.e attendees, date,time 
etc are always present in some spreadsheet which i then manually generate meetings
for. Sometimes i need to update timings etc for those meetings too.

I know they are not too much & i can create/update them manually but i am too lazy.
In this app i can just upload that spreadsheet & it creates/updates the meeting 
for me.
